NodePong is a browser-based multi-player implementation of the classic arcade game Pong, written in JavaScript. My goal is to write a very simple game playable on desktop and mobile devices, with enough features to keep it interesting. It uses:

- node.js for non-blocking server code
- socket.io for websocket integration
- jQuery for dynamic browser interaction
- jQuery mobile for mobile touch support

To run the server and serve the app, node.js and socket.io must be installed.

To play, you just need a web browser with JavaScript enabled.
